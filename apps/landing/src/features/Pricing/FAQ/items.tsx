          Withdrawing funds from Splits will transfer your balance(s) from the
          Splits ecosystem into your wallet. To withdraw funds, follow these

            In the top left of the screen, you’ll see your account. If you have

            Click the checkboxes next to each balance you want to withdraw. You
            can select as many balances as you’d like.

          When you withdraw funds from Splits, you are withdrawing your
          balance(s) across all the Splits you earn from that have been
          distributed, not just from a specific Split. This is done to maximize
          efficiency and reduce costs, since if you receive a very small portion
          of a Split and had to withdraw for that specific Split, there’s a good
          chance it would cost more to withdraw than the amount you’re
          withdrawing.
