Modules are external smart contracts that can be attached to individual pools to intercept and modify the execution flow at specific points during pool-related actions.

The logic is executed before and/or after major operations such as pool creation, deposit, or withdrawal.

Through extensions functions, developers can build sophisticated features like custom payout strategies with different pricing curves, yield farming, advanced trading features including limit orders, dynamic fee strategies, and custom oracle implementations.
Each pool is made up of one or more extensions (and one extension can serve multiple pools), they are specified during pool creation, can be openly reused and developers can implement new ones or combine extensions based on their needs.
