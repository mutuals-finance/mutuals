title: What Is Mutuals?
description: 'An unopinionated and powerful protocol for on-chain payment processing'

## Introduction

Mutuals is a peer-to-peer system designed for depositing and withdrawing cryptocurrencies (native, ERC-20, ERC-721, or ERC-1155 Tokens) according to predefined strategies on EVM-compatible blockchains.
The protocol is implemented as a set of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts; designed to prioritize censorship resistance, security, self-custody, and to function without any trusted intermediaries who may selectively restrict access.

## Why Mutuals?

There are several distinctions to make when answering this question.
From a high-level perspective, Mutuals enables *programmable payments*.
This means that incoming funds are distributed to multiple recipients based on predefined conditions - fully **automated**, **transparent** and **trustless**.
This can be used to create improved revenue-sharing arrangements, subscription services, royalties, payrolls, and more.
However, there are already several great solutions that provide similar functionality.
To explain the differences with those solutions, please have a look at our [Comparison](../comparison).

## The Mutuals Protocol

The decentralized nature of the system makes payment flows transparent, trustless, automated, and censorship resistant.
Mutuals consists of smart contracts deployed across multiple blockchain networks using open-source protocols.
Together, the contracts form a flexible payment infrastructure system.
The job of the protocol is to route incoming payments to all designated recipients according to predefined rules.
